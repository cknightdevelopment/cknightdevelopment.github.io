### Overview

Here is some overview of how to do it.

### GitHub Setup

#### 1. Create the GitHub repository
   
Create a new repository in GitHub using naming pattern of `YOURGITHUBUSERNAME.github.io` (e.g. if your GitHub username is `coder123`, then you would name the repository `coder123.github.io`). **_Your repository name must use this naming pattern, if you don't it WILL NOT WORK!_**

I would recommend creating this repository by using the GitHub website. This enables you to set up some useful things right from the get go. You can set the repository as public or private, initialize the repository with a README file, add a license, and best of all add a default Jekyll `.gitignore` file.

You can do it from the command line if you want to, but I think using the website is easier in this scenario.


### Local Setup

#### 1. Install all the things

#### 2. Generate Jekyll site files

#### 3. Build and run Jekyll site locally

#### 4. _"Deploy"_ site to GitHub

### Extra Credit

#### 1. Run site on your custom domain
