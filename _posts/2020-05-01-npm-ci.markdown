To install packages via npm I typically just use `npm install`. This works great, updates my `package.json`, allows me to install one or more packages, etc. However, I just discovered (embarrassingly) the [`npm ci` command](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/ci.html){:target="_blank"}.

This is meant to be used in automated environments like continuous integration pipelines. It will install _exactly_ what is defined in your `package-lock.json`, while also being faster, safer, etc. This should definitely be used when installing npm packages in any automated environment.
