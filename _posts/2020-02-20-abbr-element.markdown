The `<abbr>` elements represents an abbreviation and the title attribute provides a description for the abbreviation.

The default styling varies from one browser to another, but they will all indicate the abbreviation. Upon hovering over the abbreviation you can view the `title` attribute value.

#### Example

```html
<div>
  Tim Cook is the <abbr title="Chief Executive Officer">CEO</abbr> of Apple
</div>
```

#### Result

<div>
	Tim Cook is the <abbr title="Chief Executive Officer">CEO</abbr> of Apple
</div>
